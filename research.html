      <p>  It’s no secret that green energy research is critical to the future of our planet. With concerns about climate change and sustainability we are conducting extensive research in various fields to develop technologies to meet the growing demand while also reducing our impact on the planet.
        Green energy research is the study of how to generate energy using renewable resources like solar and wind power and how to make existing forms of energy production more efficient and less damaging to the environment.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <div class="sticky"><h3 style="color: white;text-align: center;">Wind Energy</h3></div><br/>
      <div class="row"> 
        <p class="col-9">Wind energy is now in the forefront of national energy policy, both politically and in research funding opportunities. It is the only renewable energy source that is cost competitive with traditional sources like gas, coal, oil, and nuclear. As a result, over the past decade wind has become the fastest growing energy source in the world.<br/>
            While wind energy technology has advanced significantly, and onshore wind energy is approaching a state of maturity, offshore wind energy presents an extremely complex technical challenge. New scientific knowledge and technology advancement are much needed for offshore wind energy systems, to increase rotor efficiency, improve turbine reliability, and reduce system costs. The transformative research proposed here will significantly impact offshore wind energy technology, and will result in more efficient, reliable, and cost effective wind energy systems<br/>
            Offshore wind energy is the generation of electricity through wind farms in bodies of water, usually at sea. There are higher wind speeds offshore than on land, so offshore farms generate more electricity per amount of capacity installed.<br/>
            The advantage of locating wind turbines offshore is that the wind is much stronger off the coasts, and unlike wind over land, offshore breezes can be strong in the afternoon, matching the time when people are using the most electricity. However, there are several disadvantages of offshore installations, related to more expensive installation, difficulty of access, and harsher conditions for the units.</p>

      <div class="sticky"><h3 style="color: white;text-align: center;">Solar Energy</h3></div><br/>
      <div class="row">
      <img class="col-5" src="solar-research.jpg">
      <p class="col-7">The Future of Solar Energy considers only the two widely recognized classes of technologies for converting solar energy into electricity — photovoltaics (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP), sometimes called solar thermal) — in their current and plausible future forms. Because energy supply facilities typically last several decades, technologies in these classes will dominate solar-powered generation between now and 2050, and we do not attempt to look beyond that date.<br/>
        Further research is being conducted for mainly 2 reasons -  First, expanding the solar industry dramatically from its relatively tiny current scale may produce changes we do not pretend to be able to foresee today. Second, we recognize that future solar deployment will depend heavily on uncertain future market conditions and public policies<br/>
        We concentrate on the use of grid-connected solar-powered generators to replace conventional sources of electricity. For the more than one billion people in the developing world who lack access to a reliable electric grid, the cost of small-scale PV generation is often outweighed by the very high value of access to electricity for lighting and charging mobile telephone and radio batteries.</p>

    <div class="sticky"><h3 style="color: white;text-align: center;">Hydro Power Energy</h3></div><br/>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-7">As the amount of wind and solar increases on our nation's grid, so does the system's need for increased flexibility. Moreover, this requirement is expected to accelerate as states strive to meet their renewable portfolio standard goals. Hydropower, with its high capacity and ability to provide medium- and long-term storage, is one of the few grid technologies well-positioned to meet these needs.<br/>
            Hydropower is energy derived from falling or fast running water. Hydro reservoirs provide built-in energy storage and the fast response time of hydropower allows it to meet sudden fluctuations in supply or demand of other renewable sources (for example solar and wind power). This means that hydropower can have an increasingly important role in providing flexibility to the electricity system.<br/>
            In a changing power system, continuous innovation is needed to keep sustainable hydropower efficient and cost-competitive, including retrofitting measures for existing plants to improve their efficiency and environmental performance.It also seeks to find better ways of minimizing the impact on the environment and ecosystems.</p>

        <div class="sticky"><h3 style="color: white;text-align: center;">Geo Thermal Energy</h3></div><br/>
        <div class="row">
          <img class="col-4" src="geo-research.png">
          <p class="col-8">There is continued extensive research going on for EcoPower Solutions to expand in the field of geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is the heat produced deep in the Earth's core. Geothermal energy is a clean, renewable resource that can be harnessed for use as heat and electricity.<br/>
            Geothermal power, (generation of electricity from geothermal energy), has been used since the 20th century. Unlike wind and solar energy, geothermal plants produce power at a constant rate, without regard to weather conditions. Geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs. Most extraction occurs in areas near tectonic plate boundaries.<br/>
            While many countries worldwide have hot geysers, only a few have tapped them to generate energy. Geothermal Energy focuses on fundamental and applied research needed to deploy technologies for developing and integrating geothermal energy as one key element in the future energy portfolio.</p>
